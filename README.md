L&amp;N STEM Code Tn Team

This repository will be written in Java Script.

We are working on creating a Solar Energy Savings Calculator for Knox County Schools.

We need to get everyone added as Collaborators so we can work together.

I don't think everyone has a github yet, so we may want to do that during genius hour today.
